Time spent drowning in the depth of the past, struggling to grasp the future
All while the moment sits patiently
Balancing delicately between the yesterday and the tommorrow
Like the peaceful eye in the middle of a hurricane
Here in a world full of mountains and clouds, big problems become small
And the possibilities become endless 
In each moment exists an indescribable beauty
Where everything is simply as it is
